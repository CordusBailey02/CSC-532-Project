## 1. Introduction
The purpose of this document is to provide a complete description of the User Interface that is part of Runtime Terror's Stack Exchange Demake Project.

The main objective is to:

* Understand how the user will transition from one window to another
* Get an overview of each interface design

### 1.1 Reference
The design contained in the document is created using Qt, a cross-platform application development framework for creating graphical user interfaces as well as cross-platform applications that run on various software and hardware platforms such as Windows, Linux, and MacOS.

This specific project makes use of C++ in Qt Creator and XML for the UI formatting, which is pre-built into Qt Creator.

URLs: www.qt.io, www.cplusplus.com, www.xml.com

***

## 2. UI Designs

### 2.1 Login

![01_Login](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4cca8c96-3136-48f6-84f9-3a30686a272f)

The first window shown to the user is this Login Window. The user has the options to login, create an account [[2.2]](https://github.com/CordusBailey02/StackExchange-Demake-Project/wiki/Graphical-User-Interface-Documentation#22-create-account), use the forgot password feature [[2.4]](https://github.com/CordusBailey02/StackExchange-Demake-Project/wiki/Graphical-User-Interface-Documentation#24-forgot-password), or close the window by clicking cancel.

If the user enters wrong or non-existing credentials, a popup [[2.14.1]](https://github.com/CordusBailey02/StackExchange-Demake-Project/wiki/Graphical-User-Interface-Documentation#-2131-login-failed) will appear.

Another popup [[2.14.2]](https://github.com/CordusBailey02/StackExchange-Demake-Project/wiki/Graphical-User-Interface-Documentation#-2142-login-successful) will appear if the login attempt is successful.

### 2.2 Create Account

![02_CreateAccount](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/161ad0ba-d546-497b-b4ee-dd77ab8f8280)

This is the create an account form users can fill out the above information to signup. Labels in the window specify parameters for some of the inputs. Length limits are set for each input, for example: the interface will not allow the password to be longer than 15 characters.

Error popups will appear if: user's email is too short [[2.14.3]](https://github.com/CordusBailey02/StackExchange-Demake-Project/wiki/Graphical-User-Interface-Documentation#-2143-email-too-short), user's email is not valid [[2.14.4]](https://github.com/CordusBailey02/StackExchange-Demake-Project/wiki/Graphical-User-Interface-Documentation#-2144-email-not-valid), given username is too short [[2.14.5]](https://github.com/CordusBailey02/StackExchange-Demake-Project/wiki/Graphical-User-Interface-Documentation#-2145-username-too-short), given password is too short [[2.14.6]](https://github.com/CordusBailey02/StackExchange-Demake-Project/wiki/Graphical-User-Interface-Documentation#-2146-password-too-short), and passwords do not match [[2.14.7]](https://github.com/CordusBailey02/StackExchange-Demake-Project/wiki/Graphical-User-Interface-Documentation#-2147-passwords-do-not-match).

Another popup [[2.14.8]](https://github.com/CordusBailey02/StackExchange-Demake-Project/wiki/Graphical-User-Interface-Documentation#-2148-account-created-successfully) will appear if the create account attempt is successful.

![99_CreateAccountParameters](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/86c86c4d-7214-4671-b453-f3c686c8c67e)

An example of valid inputs for creating an account. Note that the password field is protected.

### 2.3 Code Window

![03_CodeWindow](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/35c86474-c65f-4e87-aff4-ef11ab13390a)

From the create account window [[2.2]](https://github.com/CordusBailey02/StackExchange-Demake-Project/wiki/Graphical-User-Interface-Documentation#22-create-account), once users receive a code to their email account, they can click the "I have a code" button to submit the code as part of the verification process of an account.

Error popups will appear if the code is: not the correct length [[2.14.9]](https://github.com/CordusBailey02/StackExchange-Demake-Project/wiki/Graphical-User-Interface-Documentation#-2149-code-length-is-incorrect), not a number [[2.14.10]](https://github.com/CordusBailey02/StackExchange-Demake-Project/wiki/Graphical-User-Interface-Documentation#-21410-code-is-not-a-number), negative [[2.14.11]](https://github.com/CordusBailey02/StackExchange-Demake-Project/wiki/Graphical-User-Interface-Documentation#-21411-code-is-negative).

If successful, a popup [[2.14.12]](https://github.com/CordusBailey02/StackExchange-Demake-Project/wiki/Graphical-User-Interface-Documentation#-21412-code-accepted) will appear.

### 2.4 Forgot Password

![04_ForgotPassword](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4fa6afe6-ecbb-4a3c-b52d-e3455fc3e98e)

Once an email address is given, users will receive an email to reset their password.

Error popups will appear if the email is: too short [[2.14.3]](https://github.com/CordusBailey02/StackExchange-Demake-Project/wiki/Graphical-User-Interface-Documentation#-2143-email-too-short), not valid [[2.14.4]](https://github.com/CordusBailey02/StackExchange-Demake-Project/wiki/Graphical-User-Interface-Documentation#-2144-email-not-valid).

If the given email address is valid, a popup [[2.14.13]](https://github.com/CordusBailey02/StackExchange-Demake-Project/wiki/Graphical-User-Interface-Documentation#-21413-email-accepted) will appear.

### 2.5 Main/Home Window

![05_MainWindow](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/67dafd10-d1f5-49c1-b334-08879401c629)

This is the main window of the Application, populated with arbitrary, placeholder filler data. From here, users can ask a question [[2.6]](https://github.com/CordusBailey02/StackExchange-Demake-Project/wiki/Graphical-User-Interface-Documentation#26-ask-a-question), search [[2.7]](https://github.com/CordusBailey02/StackExchange-Demake-Project/wiki/Graphical-User-Interface-Documentation#27-search-results), see communities [[2.8]](https://github.com/CordusBailey02/StackExchange-Demake-Project/wiki/Graphical-User-Interface-Documentation#28-communities-tab), access their profile [[2.9]](https://github.com/CordusBailey02/StackExchange-Demake-Project/wiki/Graphical-User-Interface-Documentation#29-profile), and access questions directly from the feed [[2.11]](https://github.com/CordusBailey02/StackExchange-Demake-Project/wiki/Graphical-User-Interface-Documentation#211-question-page).

If the user tries a search but the text box is empty, a popup [[2.14.14]](https://github.com/CordusBailey02/StackExchange-Demake-Project/wiki/Graphical-User-Interface-Documentation#-21414-search-bar-is-empty) will appear.

### 2.6 Ask a Question

![06_AskQuestion](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/502e14b9-4b15-4492-8341-9f4feb4f3b72)

Here the user can post a question and add an image to go with it.

If the "Upload Image" button is pressed but no file is given, the informational popup [[2.14.15]](https://github.com/CordusBailey02/StackExchange-Demake-Project/wiki/Graphical-User-Interface-Documentation#-21415-no-file-selected) will appear.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5bf0745b-2dfa-4236-ad45-236ee1fbeb8b)

In this window, the user can request for verification [[2.10]](https://github.com/CordusBailey02/StackExchange-Demake-Project/wiki/Graphical-User-Interface-Documentation#210-request-verification-window) and check whether they are verified or not.

### 2.10 Request Verification Window

![98_RequestVerification](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/39967182-276d-46fe-94e1-d3442b3e338b)

This is the verification request form a user must fill out to become verified in a specific topic. There are options to add a resume, degree, certificate, and driver's license.

If the user clicks the button to add a file but does not choose any, a popup [[2.14.15]](https://github.com/CordusBailey02/StackExchange-Demake-Project/wiki/Graphical-User-Interface-Documentation#-21415-no-file-selected) will appear.

If no occupation is selected, an error popup [[2.14.20]](https://github.com/CordusBailey02/StackExchange-Demake-Project/wiki/Graphical-User-Interface-Documentation#-21420-no-occupation-selected) will appear. And if the user tries to submit the request with no files selected, another error popup [[2.14.21]](https://github.com/CordusBailey02/StackExchange-Demake-Project/wiki/Graphical-User-Interface-Documentation#-21421-no-files-selected) will appear.
